## What are Eosinophils?

Let's start at the beginning because eosinophilic esophagitis is a LONG word. There are five types of white blood cells, categorized into two main groups: Granulocytes and agranulocytes. Eosinophils are part of the granulocyte family and originate from the bone marrow. Meaning it has very tiny membranous sacs that store various enzymes for the immune system to function. Eosinophils are white blood cells that play a particularly crucial role in fighting allergens, thereby preventing foreign bacteria from infecting the body. You can think of it as an army. Each eosinophil divides up into troops and splits up and moves throughout the body, trying to locate the attacker, the attacker being the disease.

## What is Eosinophilic Esophogiatus (EoE)?

Eosinophilic Esophagitis is an immune disorder where there is an overwhelming amount of white blood cells in the lining of the esophagus. The buildup of these cells causes inflammation in the esophageal lining, which can cause an impaction in the esophagus, preventing food from moving into the stomach. Reports of EoE have been found in every continent except for Africa. EoE was found to be a progressive disorder that begins in early childhood but begins to worsen with age, with a particular peak of cases in older adolescents. Studies show that the eosinophilic granules can be toxic to a variety of tissues, including the epithelial lining of the intestines. (Rothenberg 2009\)

​EoE is usually triggered when a food the bodies consider as foreign causes an allergic response to happen. But rather than an **IgE**\-triggered reaction, such as peanuts triggering an almost immediate anaphylactic shock, with EoE, the esophagus reacts to certain foods using delayed cell-mediated processes.

## Symptoms of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?

EoE symptoms can include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), vomiting or regurgitation, chest pain, difficulty gaining weight, and discomfort after eating. Although many of these symptoms may resemble heartburn of GERD, one of the telltale signs of EoE is heartburn that doesn't respond to typical antacid medications, such as calcium carbonate-based ones like Tums or Mylanta. Another symptom is being allergic to some forms of a food but not others; for example, being able to eat highly processed products. For me personally, I found myself able to eat highly processed forms of foods that would typically bother me in their purest organic form. For example, eating raw almonds causes me stomach pain and an itchy throat, but eating almond butter is not a trigger, and can be consumed.

## Causes of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?

Eosinophils accumulate in the esophageal lining over time, especially when we repeatedly consume foods we are allergic to or encounter environmental triggers. Genetic factors also significantly influence how the esophageal lining responds and how allergy-related (Th2) immune responses are activated. For example, on my biological father's side, there is a history of GERD and other digestive disorders, while on my mother's side, there is a history of environmental allergies such as pollen and dust. Early childhood environmental exposures can further disrupt a healthy gut microbiome and increase inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining. Researchers are interested in studying how environmental exposures—such as nickel or BPAs commonly found in contact with commercial food—might trigger the onset of this disorder.

## Diagnoses of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?

Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is typically diagnosed through an endoscopic procedure, during which a biopsy is taken from the esophagus. Before my own EoE diagnosis, I believed I had no food allergies because I never experienced an obvious allergic reaction (like hives) or anaphylaxis from physical contact with foods. However, when I ingest certain foods like wheat or eggs, I would develop an upset stomach, and my throat would become itchy or even burn. An allergist explained that this is a common challenge, as standard skin prick or IgE blood tests cannot identify foods that trigger EoE symptoms. The immune response in EoE is quite different from the typical IgE-mediated food allergy response.

A study published in _Gastroenterology_, led by Dr. John Pandolfino, professor and chief of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at Northwestern, highlighted a new approach to diagnosing EoE using Flip Panometry. This emerging technique involves inserting a probe into the esophagus, inflating it, and recording esophageal function in response to the inflation. The researchers identified physiomechanical similarities in over 200 patients with EoE, including increased esophageal stiffness and altered peristaltic responses.

## Treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)?

Often to control the dysphagia that follows EoE as a gastroenterologist will prescribe a swallowing steroid such as budesonide or fluticasone. These steroids are also used in inhalation to control asthma which are used for about 3 months until treatment is ceased. This is because using the steroid for too long can cause infection of the esophagus or the mouth. Following this treatment, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) such as Protonix may be prescribed to inhibit stomach acid production.
