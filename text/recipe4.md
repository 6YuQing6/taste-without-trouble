I’ve always wanted to order those iconic bubble waffles you see at boba shops. The ones that are lightly crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the outside, and rich with that sweet eggy flavor. Unfortunately, between food restrictions and allergies, they were never an option for me. I also don't own the traditional special bubble waffle maker that is traditionally used. This recipe was created to change that and satisfy my craving for these delicious treats. Using just a standard waffle iron and carefully chosen allergen-free ingredients, this waffle mimics the delicious flavor and the texture of a classic Hong-Kong style egg waffle while still being accessible, safe, and nourishing.

## **Allergen-Free Ingredients to Consider**

When creating allergen-free treats, it is essential to choose ingredients that are safe and nutritious. Here are some great options:

### **1\. Yogurt Alternatives**

- **Coconut Yogurt**: Creamy and rich in texture, a great dairy-free option that adds moisture to baked goods and also provides healthy fats.
- **Cashew Yogurt**: Smooth and tangy, has a very neutral flavor that is a great source for plant-based fats.
- **Almond Yogurt**: Light and nutty flavor, airy and smooth. Lower-calorie and dairy free alternative that makes recipes moist and tender.

**2\. Natural Sweeteners**

- **Maple Syrup**: A natural sweetener that is free from refined sugars and adds a unique flavor.
- **Honey**: A great alternative for those who can consume it, honey has antibacterial properties and can soothe the gut.
- **Date Sugar**: Made from dried dates, this sweetener is high in fiber and nutrients.

### **3\. Dairy Alternatives**

- **Coconut Milk**: Creamy and rich, coconut milk is a great substitute for dairy in many recipes.
- **Almond Milk**: A popular dairy alternative, almond milk is low in calories and can be used in smoothies and baking.
- **Rice Milk:** Light and mildly sweet, rice milk is a gentle dairy alternative that works well in cereals, smoothies, and dessert.

**Ingredients**

**Dry Ingredients**:

- **1 cup \+ 2 tbsp GF flour**
- **1 ½ tsp of Baking Powder**
- **“Custard Powder” sub for: 1 tbsp cornstarch+1tsp of vanilla powder+ a pinch of black salt or pink himalayan salt.**
- **¼ cup tapioca flour or starch**
- **¾ cup white sugar**
- **1 tsp vanilla powder**

**Wet Ingredients:**

- **“Eggs”: 3 tbsp of arrowroot \+ ¼ cup water \+ 1 tbsp vegetable oil**
- **2 tbsp nondairy vanilla yogurt**
- **½ cup \+ 2 tbsp water**

**Instructions**:

1. In a separate bowl, mix the GF flour, baking powder, “custard powder” mix, white sugar, and tapioca flour. Move to the side when mixed.
2. In a small bowl, add the arrowroot for the egg substitute, dairy-free vanilla yogurt. Mix together until a uniform white substance forms.
3. Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix, add in the water and mix again. The mixture should only be slightly thicker than a standard pancake batter.
4. In a mixer, add the wet ingredients: 1 stick plant butter, “egg” mixture, and rice milk. Blend together.
5. Plug in your waffle-maker per the maker's instructions until appropriately heated. Use a cooking spray to grease the maker (Both top and bottom\!)
6. Pour in enough batter to cover the majority of the waffle maker, but do not overfill—leave some space around the edges.
7. Let cook for about 2-5 minutes or until the waffle is a light golden hue. Transfer on a plate to cool and firm.
8. Repeat the cooking process until all batter is used up. Refrigerate or freeze to store.

## **Tips for Baking**

- **Toppings-** Since the waffle is already sweetened itself, I like to spread plum jam on mine with a scoop of a coconut based whipped cream. It’s also good with a nice warm cup of tea.
- **“Custard”-** I found dairy-free vanilla yogurt to work the best, but if you don't have that you can mix a nondairy alternative such as oatmilk with some cornstarch and sweetener. Be aware that your waffles may come out thinner, but still have an identical taste.
- **Cooking-** Depending on what waffle iron you use, bake for 3-4 minutes more to get a more crispy and crunchy waffle. You can usually tell a waffle is fully cooked if less steam emits from the waffle iron. It’s important to note that as the waffle cools down, it will become more firm.
- **Consistency-** The chewyness of a Hong-Kong style egg waffle is characteristic, but if you don't like that, add less tapioca powder. When wet, the starch molecules in tapioca form a thick-sticky consistency–contributing to the chewyness.
- **Flavoring-** Another delicious alternative would be to add matcha powder for a great source of antioxidants, or protein powder. I found cocoa protein powder to be one of my favorite add-ins.
