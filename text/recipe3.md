![image title](./images/recipe3.Carmel_Apple_Pie_Recipe/image2.png)

Pie crust has always been my favorite part of the pie. The flavor, the warmth, that first bite—it’s what makes pie feel special to me. However, living with dysphagia can make traditional pie crusts difficult to enjoy, especially when they are crumbly, dry, or too firm to swallow comfortably.

That challenge inspired me to create a dairy-free pie crust that is both safe and enjoyable for individuals with dysphagia. This crust is soft, tender, and designed to melt in your mouth, while still delivering the initial structure, texture, and—most importantly—the classic flavor you expect from a pie crust.

This caramel apple pie is a celebration of comfort food made accessible. It proves that dietary needs do not have to mean compromise. With thoughtful ingredients and intentional preparation, this recipe offers a pie that is inclusive, flavorful, and made to be truly enjoyed by everyone.

## **Allergen-Free Ingredients to Consider**

When creating allergen-free treats, it is essential to choose ingredients that are safe and nutritious. Here are some great options:

### **1\. Gluten-Free Flours**

- **Almond Flour**: Made from finely ground almonds, this flour is rich in protein and healthy fats.
- **Coconut Flour**: A great source of fiber, coconut flour is low in carbohydrates and has a mild flavor.
- **Oat Flour**: Made from ground oats, this flour is naturally gluten-free and adds a nice texture to baked goods.

### **2\. Natural Sweeteners**

- **Maple Syrup**: A natural sweetener that is free from refined sugars and adds a unique flavor.
- **Honey**: A great alternative for those who can consume it, honey has antibacterial properties and can soothe the gut.
- **Date Sugar**: Made from dried dates, this sweetener is high in fiber and nutrients.

### **3\. Dairy Alternatives**

- **Coconut Milk**: Creamy and rich, coconut milk is a great substitute for dairy in many recipes.
- **Almond Milk**: A popular dairy alternative, almond milk is low in calories and can be used in smoothies and baking.
- **Rice Milk:** Light and mildly sweet, rice milk is a gentle dairy alternative that works well in cereals, smoothies, and dessert.

### **4\. Salt Alternatives**

- **Pink Himalayan Salt:** Sourced from ancient salt deposits and contains trace minerals such as potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals support hydration and electrolyte balance, which can aid normal digestive processes and gut function. Its mild flavor makes it easy to use without over-salting.
- **Sea Salt:** Harvested from evaporated seawater and undergoes minimal processing, allowing it to retain natural minerals. Adequate mineral intake plays a role in stomach acid production, which is essential for proper digestion and nutrient absorption.
- **Flake Salt:** Light, delicate texture and dissolves quickly, allowing you to use less while still enhancing flavor. Using smaller amounts of salt can help reduce digestive discomfort for individuals sensitive to high sodium intake, making flake salt a gut-conscious finishing option.

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).pestle to ground the fennel seeds. When fully grounded, add to the bowl.
2. In a medium bowl mix together the dry ingredients: flour, and pink himalayan salt. Create a well in the middle.
3. Using a cheese grater–using the coarse hole side– grate the chilled plant butter stick onto a plate, and then transfer to the well. Add the Crisco to the well besides the butter.
4. Using your fingers, start folding the mixture until it becomes a crumbly, but soft consistency that does not stick to your fingers. If the mixture continues to stick to your fingers, add more flour. If the crumbles are too dry and stick together, add cold or room temperature water and continue to knead.
5. Form the dough into a coin shape and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or until dough is firmer.
6. Repeat this exact process again so that you have a total of two dough balls–both in the fridge.

7. Peel and core a total of six apples (three granny smith and three honeycrisp). Cut into quarters. If you do not have an apple corer. Peel and core manually, cut the apple into thin slices and then into halves. Transfer into a medium-large bowl, and start an initial dousing of lemon juice to prevent too much oxidation.
8. In a small bowl mix together the seasonings and dry ingredients: brown sugar,cinnamon, all spice, nutmeg, ginger, and cardamom. Mix until uniform and put to the side.
9. Spoon 3 tbsp of cornstarch into the bowl with the apple slices and mix. Pour in spice seasoning mixture until all layers of apples are coated evenly.
10. Add ¼ cup of lemon juice into the bowl and mix until a creamy brown substance forms–coating the apples.

**Instructions for Making Carmel**:

11. Begin warming a medium saucepan on light heat, a medium sized saucepan, add the brown sugar, vegan butter, salt, and oatmilk.
12. Bring to a simmer over low-medium heat and whisk constantly throughout the process.
13. Once the caramel is simmering and bubbles start to form, stir for another 8 minutes until the sauce becomes slightly thickened. (Note: it’s ok if the sauce is not fully thickened. As the sauce cools down it will begin to thicken.)
14. Stir in the vanilla powder and then take off of heat.

**Assembling the Applepie**:

15. This is a softer dough so you will need to work quickly. Lightly dust a clean work surface and a rolling pin with gluten-free flour, making sure the surface is cool at neutral temp. Remove one of the crusts from the fridge and begin to roll out the dough evenly, adding flour when it begins to stick. Roll until the crust is a quarter of an inch thick.
16. Begin to spoon in the apple filling. Layer the caramel syrup between each layer of the apple filling. Set to the side when all the filling is used up and the pie is full. Do not underfill the pie as the apples will bake down in the oven.
17. Grab the second dough from the fridge and repeat the rolling and flouring process until a quarter inch thickness. Lay the second dough on top of the pie to create a covering crust. Crimp the edges by pinching and cut four slits in the middle.
18. The pie will bake for a total of 50-60 minutes. When the timer hits 30 minutes, cover the top with tinfoil to avoid the top crust from burning. If no darkening is happening do not put the foil covering.
19. Once the pie is done, the middle should be penetrable with no hard uncooked apples in the way. Remove from the over and let cool for 1 hour to set.

## **Tips for Baking**

- **Pie Crust-** My mom taught me a simple trick for transferring pie crusts, since the dough can be delicate and prone to breaking. Gently roll the crust onto your rolling pin, then carefully unroll it into the pie pan.
- **Excess Ingredients-** if you have excess pie crust and seasoning left, create fun shapes with the excess dough, and coat with the excess sugar and spice mix. Put in the oven for 30-40 minutes and let cool for a delicious treat\!
- **Carmel-** When making the carmel, make sure to use a thicker milk substitute such as coconut milk concentrate, or extra creamy oat milk (barista kind is the best) almond milk and rice milk will work, but will make a much looser caramel syrup.
- **Baking-** For a crispier crust increase the ratio of crisco to butter. Leave pie in oven at 425 degrees fahrenheit for an initial 10 minutes.
- **Cooling-** Letting the pie cool overnight is actually ideal. It gives a chance for the pie crust to firm, caramel to thicken, and spices to be absorbed into the apples.
