## **Allergen-Free Ingredients to Consider**

When creating allergen-free treats, it is essential to choose ingredients that are safe and nutritious. Here are some great options:

### **1\. Gluten-Free Flours**

- **Almond Flour**: Made from finely ground almonds, this flour is rich in protein and healthy fats.
- **Coconut Flour**: A great source of fiber, coconut flour is low in carbohydrates and has a mild flavor.
- **Oat Flour**: Made from ground oats, this flour is naturally gluten-free and adds a nice texture to baked goods.

### **2\. Natural Sweeteners**

- **Maple Syrup**: A natural sweetener that is free from refined sugars and adds a unique flavor.
- **Honey**: A great alternative for those who can consume it, honey has antibacterial properties and can soothe the gut.
- **Date Sugar**: Made from dried dates, this sweetener is high in fiber and nutrients.

### **3\. Dairy Alternatives**

- **Coconut Milk**: Creamy and rich, coconut milk is a great substitute for dairy in many recipes.
- **Almond Milk**: A popular dairy alternative, almond milk is low in calories and can be used in smoothies and baking.
- **Rice Milk:** Light and mildly sweet, rice milk is a gentle dairy alternative that works well in cereals, smoothies, and dessert.

**Ingredients**

**Ingredients for the Chai Spice**:

- **½ tsp Cinnamon**
- **⅛ tsp cardamom**
- **¼ tsp Fennel Seed** (Ground up)
- **⅙ \-⅛ tsp _tumeric_**
- **⅛ tsp _ginger_**

**Ingredients for the Cookie**:

- **¼ cup brown sugar**
- **½ tsp salt**
- **5 tbsp of granulated sugar**
- **¼ tsp Baking soda**
- **¼ tsp Baking powder**
- **2 tsp Vanilla powder**
- **2 cups flour**
- **1 stick plant butter**
- **1 tbsp of arrowroot \+ 1/4 cup of water+1tbsp veggie oil \= 1 Egg**
- **¼ cup of Rice milk**

**Instructions**:

1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and put to the side.
2. In a small bowl mix together the cinnamon, cardamom, turmeric, and _ginger_ spices. Use either a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to ground the fennel seeds. When fully grounded, add to the bowl.
3. In a medium bowl mix together the dry ingredients: flour, brown sugar, salt, granulated sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and the vanilla powder.
4. In a mixer, add the wet ingredients: 1 stick plant butter, “egg” mixture, and rice milk. Blend together.
5. Keep mixer on low power as you add in the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients–¼ cup at a time until fully mixed. Texture should be smooth, but scoopable.
6. Scoop a dough ball onto the baking sheet, evenly spaced, and use a spoon to press down gently to flatten.
7. Bake the cookies for 10-15 minutes. Take them out when the cookies feel firm.
8. Let cookies sit on the pan for 5 minutes, and then transfer to the cooling rack to cool.
9. Once cooled, melt the dairy-free white chocolate chips until it's at a “drizzle” consistency.
10. Drizzle melted white chocolate chips over cookies with a fork or any utensil of your choosing\!

## **Tips for Baking**

- **Eggs-** I recommend mixing the arrowroot “egg” mixture in a separate bowl before adding to the wet ingredients. This can help prevent separation of the mixture from the batter. If you do not have arrowroot, use ¼ cup of unsweetened applesauce.
- **Spices-** This all depends on your preference\! I found these spices to mimic the chai flavor the best. An alternative would be to substitute and use an actual chai-tea or chai-coffee mix instead.
- **Sugar-** If you want a mildly sweet cookie, I recommend using the sugar amount the recipe suggests. For a sweeter cookie, use 1 cup of sugar.
- **Scooping-** Use a small to medium sized ice cream scooper to get the perfect ball.
- **Baking-** Unsure if the cookies are fully baked or not? Use a toothpick to poke a hole in the center of one cookie. If the toothpick comes out clean it's done, if not then the cookies need more time to bake. Do not overbake them,during the cooling process, the cookies will firm.
- **Cooling-** Leave in the fridge overnight to allow cookies to completely absorb the spice mix.
