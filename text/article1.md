## How Our Thinking of Food and Our Bodies Changes as We Age

I happily remember eating when I was younger, before my digestive disease or disordered eating patterns had come into play. Food was both an exciting event and a passive experience at the same time. The “exciting event” was going out to eat, and having food made for you in a different environment. The passive part was simply choosing from the menu and eating what was placed in front of you. When we are young, we tend to enjoy familiar foods, like the infamous chicken tenders and fries, but actively eating them usually isn’t a conscious experience. From toddlerhood through preschool, eating largely remains passive. As we approach the end of the preschool years, we may start to become slightly more aware of our food and our likes and dislikes begin to shift.

By school age (around 6–10 years old), the ability to control attention becomes more developed. Children at this age are better able to focus on what they are eating. By this point, most children have formed clear likes and dislikes and tend to be very opinionated about their food. Eating is still somewhat passive, but it becomes more conscious at the same time. This is also when socialization with playmates begins to play a larger role—food becomes a social experience through school lunches, playdates, and eating with peers. The ability to choose what to eat and what not to eat starts to matter more, and those choices feel more intentional.

From ages 10–18, the adolescent stage, we experience probably the most significant shift in our relationship with food. This is a time of major brain development, as well as growing awareness of our bodies, identity, and sexuality. I remember being only 11 years old and worrying that I looked too big in my swimsuit. I became aware that my body was very different from my peers, and self-consciousness began to take hold. During this stage our awareness of what we are eating is almost completely developed. We begin to focus on food more. Whether this means actively seeking out new eating experiences or, contrarily, restricting which foods go into our bodies. I think of adolescence as a tension between enjoyment and dissatisfaction with food. To divide this up, between ages 10–12, we slowly move out of that passive stage and become more aware of how food affects our bodies. From 13–18, food becomes increasingly complex. We go out with friends and want to try new things, but our enjoyment is often influenced by our body consciousness. At the same time we become able to recognize how different foods affect us physically, which can sometimes make eating feel less enjoyable than more. 

Emerging adulthood (ages 18–39), particularly the late 20s to early 30s, can also be characterized as an ever-changing time for the body and for one’s relationship with food. Many people become more focused on fitness, and with the rise of social media, body image becomes more prominent in our culture. Because of this, how we appear both online and in person often dictates how we eat and how we think about food. With more independence in adulthood comes more control over food choices, so more drastic changes such as weight loss or weight gain, can often become more prominent during this time. Food is no longer just something shared socially but something we actively manage in relation to our bodies.

 Often, people say their 30s are the best time of their life because they begin to live for themselves, making choices about both food and body that feel more aligned and self-directed. By the time people reach their 30s, as social networks expand it becomes less about fitting in with other bodies around you and more about being the best version of yourself. During this stage, the body is often at or near its full capacity, and food plays a role in fueling that potential—whether that means supporting physical activity, energy levels, or overall well-being. It often becomes less about changing the body you are in and more about understanding how to work with it and push the limits of what it can do. Food becomes less about other people’s expectations and more about personal needs and intentions. 

Middle adulthood marks a significant shift in how we experience our bodies and our relationship with food. During this stage physiological and psychological changes such as menopause and andropause begin to occur, and the body naturally starts to age. Foods that once felt easy to digest become harder to metabolize, and weight gain is common–even though appetite often decreases in ways that don’t align with a slowing metabolism. Because of this, many people become more conscious of how much they are eating rather than what they are eating. The types of foods we choose to eat are often shaped earlier in life, during emerging and young adulthood, a period largely defined by experimentation and habit formation. However, In middle age, attention frequently shifts to portion sizes, measurements, and quantity as the body responds differently than it once did. There is often regression in a sense in our relationship with our bodies during this stage also. By this point many individuals have experienced major life changes, such as having children, and physical changes become more visible. In men weight often accumulates around the midsection; in women, body composition shifts in ways throughout that can feel unfamiliar or disagreeable. These changes can bring back a creeping insecurity similar to adolescence, being the uneasy transition from a teenage body to an adult one. 

As an older adult (65 years and older), sensory skills, motor skills, and overall mobility naturally decline. At this stage individuals often re-enter that regressive phase by relearning how to perform activities of daily living (ADLs) within the limits of their current abilities. After working in a care home, studying geriatrics, and observing older adults in my own life a common pattern I have noticed is the difficulty many older adults have with consuming nutritious foods. Older adults often gravitate toward foods that are high in salt and carry artificial flavorings, such as MSG as well as sweets. Because they are in a regressive state, they may also seek comfort foods from earlier in life; foods that are typically high in fats, sugars, and carbohydrates. According to the Asian Heart Institute in Mumbai studies have shown that “People aged 65 years and older are the group with the highest rate of increase in diabetes diagnoses.” On the other hand, it is also common for older adults to develop disordered eating habits, especially if there is a history of these behaviors earlier in life. This can include intentionally skipping meals due to a lack of perceived hunger despite the body’s continued need for proper nutrition. In many cases these behaviors are not fully conscious. Memory impairments that come with aging can lead to forgetting to eat altogether or being unsure whether a meal has already been had, which further contributes to inadequate nutrition.

These challenges are not limited to one stage of life but emerge in different forms throughout the aging process. For individuals who grow up with food allergies or digestive issues, this experience is often more complex. From a young age, they become highly aware of how food affects their bodies which can create a greater sense of responsibility but also create isolation. Many children with dietary restrictions struggle to fit in and miss out on the shared excitement of eating what is considered “trendy” or socially normalized. Across the lifespan, food is frequently tied to shame, a concept so deeply embedded in our culture. Whether it is being teased for culturally different foods, separated due to allergies, or unable to participate in social eating events as an adult– these experiences accumulate and shape our relationship with food. Over time internalizing shame can contribute to disordered eating patterns and a harmful connection to nourishment. To combat this we must prioritize inclusivity in how we approach food at every stage of life. And normalize dietary differences while encouraging safe and individualized ways to explore food  that allows people to nourish their bodies without conforming to diet culture or mainstream expectations. Food should be both enjoyable and supportive of health and cultivate connection and not exclusion.
